# APS_TestBed
This repo incudel a closed-loop platform with classical artificial pancreas (AP) controllers (OpenAPS and Basal-Bolus) and
two glucose simulators (Glucosym and UVA-Padova), which (1) enables experimental evaluation of different controllers,
prediction algorithms, and pump functionalities, or other studies on APS that do not have access to clinical patients;
(2) integrates a fault injection engine to simulate potential safety and security issues and adverse events in APS caused
by accidental software and hardware faults, human errors, or malicious attacks.
